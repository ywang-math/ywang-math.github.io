<p>
I am a Ph.D student in Mathematics at University of Pennsylvania. My advisor is <a href="https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~hartmann/">Julia Hartmann</a>.. I am interested in algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. In particular, I am currently working on representations of algebraic groups, differential Galois theory and the patching techniques.

Before Penn, I was an undergraduate student at University of California, Berkeley.
