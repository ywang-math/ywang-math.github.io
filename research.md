My research interests lie broadly in algebra, in particular the intersection with algebraic and arithmetic geometry. More specifically, I study representations of algebraic groups, Galois cohomology and differential Galois theory. I have been working on the local aspects and the local-global principles of algebraic objects in the following directions:
