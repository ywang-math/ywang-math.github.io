My research interests lie broadly in algebra, in particular the intersection with algebraic and arithmetic geometry. More specifically, I study representations of algebraic groups, Galois cohomology and differential Galois theory. I have been working on the local aspects and the local-global principles of algebraic objects in the following directions:

(1). Arithmetic invariant theory of reductive groups. 17 pages. Preprint available at [arXiv:2212.12863](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12863).

(2). The local-global principle over function fields of curves over excellent henselian discretely valued fields and its application to the generalized period-index problem. Manuscript in preparation.

(3). Local-global principles in differential Galois theory.
