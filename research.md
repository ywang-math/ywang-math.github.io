My research interests lie broadly in algebra, in particular the intersection with algebraic and arithmetic geometry. More specifically, I study representations of algebraic groups, Galois cohomology and differential Galois theory. I have been working on the local aspects and the local-global principles of algebraic objects in the following directions:

(1). Arithmetic invariant theory of algebraic groups over rings. Manuscript in preparation.

(2). The local-global principle over function fields of curves over excellent henselian discretely valued fields and its application to the generalized period-index problem.

(3). Local-global principles in differential Galois theory.
