My research interests lie broadly in algebra, focusing on the intersection with algebraic and arithmetic geometry and algebraic number theory. 
I am in particular interested in the local aspects and the local-global principles of algebraic objects, as well as their obstructions in the following directions:
</p>

  * Patching for arithmetic curves and local-global principles.
  * The arithmetic of algebraic stacks with applications to number theory.
  * Topics that are broadly related to algebraic groups, such as invariant theory, differetial Galois theory and toric varieties.
